    This is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_car">wikipedia</a>:<br> A sports car, or sportscar, is a small, usually two-seater, two-door automobile designed for spirited performance and nimble handling.[2][3] The term "sports car" was used in The Times, London in 1919.[4] According to USA's Merriam-Webster dictionary, USA's first known use of the term was in 1928.[2] Sports cars started to become popular during the 1920s.[5]
    Sports cars may be spartan or luxurious, but high maneuverability and light weight are requisite.[6] Sports cars are usually aerodynamically shaped (since the 1950s), and have a low center of gravity compared to standard models. Steering and suspension are typically designed for precise control at high speeds.[7] Traditionally sports cars were open roadsters, but closed coup√©s also started to become popular during the 1930s, and the distinction between a sports car and a grand tourer is not absolute.[8][9]
